The frontend web application has been built using Anvil. You can find the source code of the frontend at [client_code/Form1/__init__py](client_code/Form1/__init__py). To recreate the frontend, you can go to https://anvil.works and replicate the frontend elements from https://apprentice.anvil.app/ in a drag and drop manner and use the code from [client_code/Form1/__init__py](client_code/Form1/__init__py)
